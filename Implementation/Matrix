Assignment: Recursion Implementation Exercise
Team Name: Matrix
Members: Christopher Presnell & Logan Turbyfill



Clarification Questions:

1) What is the max / min values the user can enter.
2) what type of numbers are allowed? Int, float, ect.
3)Psudo code in text file or visual studio file.
4)How should the psudo code be structured? One line or is bullet points okay with clarifying sub-points.

Pseudo Code Implementation:

User Input variable initialized;
Integer variable initialized;
second Integer variable initialized;
Result variable initaialized;

Write to screen to prompt user for an integer.

Read user input;
	Try:
		Parse user input to verify input is Integer.

	Catch:
		Promt user to re-enter input, last attemp wasn't an integer.

Store user input in Integer variable;


		 

Recursion Method:

For
 	(int i = User Integer, i <= 1; i--)
		
		user Integer mod Integer of 10 to get last digit off number.
    User integer - second integer variable = result

End For

print result.
